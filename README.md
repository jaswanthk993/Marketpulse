# 🚀 BizPilot AI – AI Copilot for Small Businesses

Small businesses generate sales and inventory data every day, but most owners don’t have the time or expertise to analyze it. Dashboards exist, but they are complex, passive, and built for enterprises—not for small business owners who need **clear decisions, fast**.

**BizPilot AI** is an AI-powered copilot that turns raw business data into **simple, actionable decisions using natural language**.

## 💡 What is the problem?

* Frequent stock-outs and overstocking
* Poor visibility into profits and losses
* Manual analysis and guesswork
* No access to analysts or advanced tools

Data exists, but **insight does not**.

## 🧠 The Core Idea

Replace dashboards and reports with an **AI Copilot** that behaves like a virtual business assistant.

Users simply ask:

* *“What should I reorder today?”*
* *“Which products are losing money?”*
* *“Why did my sales drop last week?”*

BizPilot AI analyzes sales and inventory data, forecasts demand, detects risks, and responds with **clear answers + explanations**.
